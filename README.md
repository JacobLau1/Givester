# Givester
**Mcgill CodeJam 13** - Hackathon project
by Jeffrey Lim and Jacob Lau

### Inspiration
In light of recent events and the rise of cost of living, volunteer work is now more important than ever.

### What it does
Therefore we wanted to create **Givester**, a website that will facilitate the sharing of volunteering events . The events page shows a list of events that users can apply to volunteer for, with their emails (which is validated).

### How we built it
We used Django framework for the structure, and html and css for the web page. Also javascript was used for a pop-up.

### Challenges we ran into
There was one git conflict, also the challenge of passing the id of the event through the url and getting it on the form page.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to put together a decent looking web application, with a nice user interface, as well as functionality.

### What we learned
We learned how to make a web application using django, html and css. We also used bootstrap, and learned how to use use virtual environments in vscode. We also cemented our knowledge with github.

### What's next for Givester
If we were to continue working on this project, we would add a login functionality, make a user type and an admin type, allow admin to use crud on the events, make the events send something to the email, and add filtering and pagination.
